  <description>The SKS is a weapon born in the brief silence between two global storms — not a prototype, but a transition. Designed on Old Earth in the closing days of its second great war, it marked a critical step between bolt-action relics and the automatic age to come.

Developed by Soviet engineer Sergei Simonov and chambered in the emerging 7.62×39mm intermediate cartridge, the SKS was rugged, accurate, and easy to maintain. It lacked full-auto capability, but made up for it in reliability — a soldier’s rifle, built for survival more than glory.

Centuries after Earth’s fall into silence, its design was recovered from a decaying memory core aboard a dead orbital station. Scattered data, rebuilt by a Rimworld weaponsmith, gave it new life.

Now, the SKS serves once again — in the hands of settlers, survivalists, and militias. Not flashy. Not rare. But real.

A weapon of the in-between. A rifle that never quit. Reborn from ruins — steady, silent, and ready.
