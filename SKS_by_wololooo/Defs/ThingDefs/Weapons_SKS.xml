    <description>The SKS is a weapon born in the quiet between two storms — not a prototype, not yet an assault rifle, but something in between. Forged in the final days of Old Earth’s second great war, it marked the fading of bolt-action doctrine and the first glimmer of the automatic age.

Designed by Soviet engineer Sergei Simonov, the SKS was chambered in the then-new 7.62×39mm cartridge — smaller, lighter, more controllable. The rifle offered a ten-round internal magazine, semi-automatic fire, and rugged reliability. Not flashy, but practical. Not perfect, but trusted.

By the time it entered service, Earth was already shifting. The AK-47 soon overtook it, and the SKS was pushed aside — handed to militias, parades, and forgotten garrisons. Yet it endured. Through proxy wars, revolts, and ruin, it kept firing.

After Earth fell — to fire, famine, and silence — the SKS vanished like so many others. But the Rim forgets nothing.

Centuries later, a degraded schematic surfaced in the memory of a dead orbital node. A weaponsmith, driven by necessity, rebuilt it — scavenged, welded, reborn. Now the SKS fires again on fractured worlds where civilization cracked and faded.

It lacks full-auto. It doesn’t dazzle. But it works.

A relic from the end of an age — modest in design, unshakable in legacy. Still here. Still ready.
