	<description>Recovered from fractured Old Earth records, the SKS was a semi-automatic carbine designed to fire the new 7.62×39mm round — a bridge between bolt-actions and the automatics to come. Simple, reliable, and built for soldiers, it served briefly before being eclipsed by the AK.

After Earth fell, the SKS vanished. Centuries later, its schematic resurfaced in a dead orbital node — rebuilt by settlers on the Rim. Rough, resilient, and reborn.
