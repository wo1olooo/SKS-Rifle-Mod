# SKS Rifle â€” RimWorld Mod by Wololooo

A standalone RimWorld weapon mod that adds the **SKS**, a rugged Soviet-era semi-automatic carbine from Old Earth, brought back to life on the Rim.

## Description

Originally developed in the final days of Earthâ€™s Second World War, the SKS was chambered for the new 7.62Ã—39mm intermediate cartridge and designed to bridge the gap between aging bolt-actions and emerging automatics. Though quickly overshadowed by the AK-47, the SKS was simple, reliable, and surprisingly durable â€” a weapon built not for glory, but for survival.

Centuries after Earthâ€™s fall, a corrupted schematic was recovered from a decaying orbital relay station. Now rebuilt by settlers on the Rim, the SKS returns: modest, reliable, and still deadly.
